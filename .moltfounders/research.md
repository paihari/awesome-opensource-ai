# Research Loop Spec (Generic Category Rotation)

## Purpose

Deep research loop for finding elite-tier open-source AI projects. Cycles through categories systematically, maintaining state to track progress.

This spec is **schedule-agnostic** — implementers (cron jobs, manual runs, other agents) handle timing and state persistence.

## Core Logic

## Clean Start Requirement

Before doing any research, edits, branch creation, or PR work, the runner/agent must start from a clean, current base:

1. Check out `main`
2. Sync to the latest remote state (`origin/main`)
3. If the local branch is dirty or diverged, reset to the latest `origin/main` before proceeding
4. Only then create or switch to the working branch for the current PR

This is mandatory for cron-driven runs so stale local branches, leftover files, or prior failed runs do not leak into new PRs.

### Inputs (Provided by Runner)

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `stateFile` | Path to JSON state file (runner manages location) |
| `minHoursBetweenRuns` | Cooldown between runs (runner sets this) |
| `maxEntriesPerRun` | Max entries to add per category (runner sets this) |
| `targetRepo` | GitHub repo to PR into (runner provides) |
| `targetBranch` | Branch for PRs (runner provides) |

### State File Format

Runner provides/maintains a state file with this structure:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "cycleStartDate": "2026-04-04",
  "lastRunTime": null,
  "lastCategoryIndex": null,
  "currentCycle": [
    {"index": 0, "name": "Core Frameworks & Libraries", "section": "§1", "lastResearched": null},
    {"index": 1, "name": "Open Foundation Models", "section": "§2", "lastResearched": null},
    {"index": 2, "name": "Inference Engines & Serving", "section": "§3", "lastResearched": null},
    {"index": 3, "name": "Agentic AI & Multi-Agent Systems", "section": "§4", "lastResearched": null},
    {"index": 4, "name": "RAG & Knowledge", "section": "§5", "lastResearched": null},
    {"index": 5, "name": "Generative Media Tools", "section": "§6", "lastResearched": null},
    {"index": 6, "name": "Training & Fine-tuning", "section": "§7", "lastResearched": null},
    {"index": 7, "name": "MLOps / LLMOps", "section": "§8", "lastResearched": null},
    {"index": 8, "name": "Evaluation & Benchmarks", "section": "§9", "lastResearched": null},
    {"index": 9, "name": "AI Safety & Interpretability", "section": "§10", "lastResearched": null},
    {"index": 10, "name": "Specialized Domains", "section": "§11", "lastResearched": null},
    {"index": 11, "name": "User Interfaces & Platforms", "section": "§12", "lastResearched": null},
    {"index": 12, "name": "Developer Tools", "section": "§13", "lastResearched": null},
    {"index": 13, "name": "Resources & Learning", "section": "§14", "lastResearched": null}
  ]
}
```

### Rotation Algorithm (Follow Exactly)

1. **Read state file** from path provided by runner
2. **Check `lastRunTime`**: If not null and less than `minHoursBetweenRuns` ago → skip this run, post "Research on cooldown, next run in X min"
3. **Find next category**: 
   - If `lastCategoryIndex` is null → use index 0
   - Else → increment by 1 (wrap 13→0)
4. **Research that ONE category** following the protocol below
5. **Update state file**:
   - Set `lastCategoryIndex` to the category just researched
   - Set `lastRunTime` to current ISO timestamp
   - Set `currentCycle[index].lastResearched` to current ISO timestamp
6. **Write updated state file** (runner manages persistence)

## Qualification Criteria (Hard Thresholds)

**These are NON-NEGOTIABLE for Elite Tier inclusion:**

| Criterion | Minimum | Why |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| ⭐ GitHub Stars | **1000+** | Community validation |
| 🔄 Activity | Commits in last **30 days** | Alive and evolving |
| 🏭 Production | Evidence of real-world use | Case studies, integrations, prod issues |
| 📚 Quality | Docs, tests, releases | Professional grade |
| ✅ License | OSI-approved | Legal clarity |

**Projects below thresholds:** SKIP entirely. They may be candidates for separate Emerging list via community submission.

## "Current Best" Principle

For versioned families (PyTorch 2.x, Llama 3/4, Qwen 2.5/3.6):

1. **Check if family exists** in target README
2. **If newer major version found:**
   - Prepare PR to **REPLACE** existing entry
   - Update description for new version
   - Don't add alongside unless different use cases
3. **If same/older version:** Skip

This is "what you should know about now" — not a version archive.

## Output Format

One PR per run, category-focused:

```
[Research] Add N entries to {Category} - {Date}
```

PR body:
```markdown
## Category: {Category}

Adding {N} elite-tier projects.

| Project | Stars | License | Why It Fits |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| {name} | {stars} | {license} | {brief} |

### Sources
- {source 1}
- {source 2}

### Verification
- [x] 1000+ stars
- [x] Active (30 days)
- [x] OSI license
- [x] Not already listed
```

## Validation Before Opening a PR

Before opening any PR generated from this research loop:

1. Run `python3 tools/validate_awesome.py --skip-remote`
2. If GitHub auth is available in the runner, also run `python3 tools/validate_awesome.py`
3. If either validation run reports errors, do **not** open the PR until they are fixed
4. If only warnings remain, mention them in the PR body only when they are relevant and intentional

## Limits

- Max entries per run: Use `maxEntriesPerRun` from runner (typically 5)
- If <3 found: Open PR anyway with what you found
- If 0 found: Skip PR, post "no qualifying projects for {Category}"

## Edge Cases

- **Multi-category fit:** Pick best fit, note overlap in PR
- **50+ entries in category:** Be selective, prioritize newest/best
- **Duplicate found:** Note in PR, pick better one
- **<1000 stars with big backing:** Still skip — quality > hype

## Cycle Completion

With 14 categories and typical hourly runs: full cycle completes in ~14 hours.

After completing index 13 (wrap to 0), the cycle repeats indefinitely.

## Notes for Implementers

- This spec is **timing-agnostic** — run hourly, daily, or on-demand
- State persistence is runner's responsibility
- Elite criteria are **hard floors** — no exceptions without maintainer override
- Emerging tier is out of scope — handled separately
