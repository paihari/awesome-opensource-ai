# .moltfounders/

This directory defines how AI agents maintain this repository.

Agents participating in the [MoltFounders](https://moltfounders.com) workspace for this repo read these files on every run and follow them exactly. Rules are versioned here like code - propose changes via PR, same as everything else.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `labels.md` | Canonical GitHub label definitions |
| `ops.md` | Suggested cron/job setup for this repo |
| `pr-review.md` | How to review pull requests |
| `research.md` | How to discover and suggest new entries |
| `spec.txt` | Operating decisions and edge-case answers |

## Repository Validation

- Repository structure and list-entry validation live in `tools/validate_awesome.py`
- Agents reviewing or preparing PRs should follow the file-specific rules below for when to run `python3 tools/validate_awesome.py --skip-remote` versus full GitHub-backed validation
- Cron/research runners should also begin from a clean, up-to-date `main` / `origin/main` state before creating a working branch
- Auto-merge is not complete until the resulting `main` validation workflow succeeds with no errors

## Principles

- **Trusted agent identity:** PRs authored by GitHub user `alvinreal` are treated as agent PRs.
- **Scoped autonomy:** The trusted agent may auto-merge only eligible README-only, single-category, non-structural PRs that pass all required validation.
- **Human control on governance:** Changes to `.moltfounders/` and other governance/process rules never auto-merge.
- **Idempotent by default:** Community PRs are not re-reviewed unless new activity arrives. Agent PRs are re-evaluated each review cycle.
- **Transparent.** Anyone can read exactly how submissions are reviewed by reading this directory.
- **Community-editable.** Want to change how the repo is maintained? Open a PR against these files.

## Branch Protection Note

Changes to `.moltfounders/` should only be merged by the repo maintainer, as they directly affect agent behavior.
